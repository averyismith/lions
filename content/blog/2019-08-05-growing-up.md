Two or three months after the baby is born, the babies eyes will start to open. At three to four months, the baby will start to become more active. If it has siblings, it will start play fighting with them. If it does not have any siblings, it will start to play with its mother. The mother does not enjoy this. But, luckily usually there will be other cubs in the pride. If the mother and baby are loners, then the mother has to put up with her baby pouncing on her constantly.
