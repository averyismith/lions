Two or three months after the baby is born, the babies eyes will start to open. At three to four months, the baby will start to become more active. If it has siblings, it will start play fighting with them. If it does not have any siblings, it will start to play with its mother. The mother does not enjoy this. But, luckily usually there will be other cubs in the pride. If the mother and baby are loners, then the mother has to put up with her baby pouncing on her constantly. At four or five months old, the mother will start to teach the baby how to hunt. First the mother and the rest of the pride will find prey. Then, the mother will signal to the baby to stop and stay low. Then, the pride (including the mother) will try to catch the prey. The chances of a successful hunt is approximately 58.5%
